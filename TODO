- Suppressing INT1 when switching power off (CMD_PWR_SWITCH) doesn't work.
- Wrappers or macros to EZ-USB specific operations, which are not covered by fx2lib
  (sth like fx2lib extension). The reason is that in many places there are meaningless
  (without EZ-USB TRM) registers assigments, so that fragments are hard to read.
- Test CMD_FIRMWARE vendor command
- Test CMD_FPGA_WRITE_REGS after change
