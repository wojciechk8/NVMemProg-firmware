1. Status polling on ep1in returns state from the previous read, not the actual.
   Check if it's possible to fix. Maybe move status polling to EP0?
   
   It's possible to fix using the In-Bulk-NAK interrupt.
   
   Done, OK

2. Give feedback about the data write completeness in 28f interface.
   It could be done via ifc_busy function, by checking endpoint empty flag.

3. Suppressing INT1 when switching power off (CMD_PWR_SWITCH) doesn't work.
